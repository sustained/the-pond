# The Pond

The Pond serves, I guess, three primary purposes:

1. A place for people I met from other servers (mostly language-related ones) to hang out.
2. A place for my various language-related projects to call home.
3. A place for language-learning; programming; gaming etc. nerds/geeks in general, I guess?

## Projects

### Swedish for Toads

Swedish for Toads is my crown jewel; it is my magnum opus; it's the place I'm pouring the majority of my blood, sweat and tears.

It's basically just an app for helping people to learn Swedish (one of my passions) born out of various frustrations with the existing solutions with some (in my opinion) new and interesting ideas which haven't been experimented with before.

It's closed source and I at least *hope* to turn it into a small business if at all possible, long-term.

### Fladdermus

Fladdermus is my pet project; it is my safe haven; it's where I go when I need to code something a bit more... fun and relaxing.

I had grand plans for (which you can read about on my Patreon if you care to find it) it but those are on hold due to reasons™.

### Duocord

Duocord is a Chrome extension which acts as a bridge between [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and [Discord](https://www.discordapp.com/). It's not yet released.

It basically just sends fancy messages over to whatever Discord servers/channels you specify automatically whenever you reach certain milestones.

It's just a little learning project (wanted a bit of hands on experience with Discord RPC and browser extensions) and also serves the purpose of "résumé-padding", right?

### More?

Hopefully there will be more language-learning related projects, in time.
